# Weather-Dashboard

## Project Description

The purpose of this application is to allow the user to search a valid location of their interest,
and they are presented with the current weather conditions within that location as well as a five-
day forecast with weather conditions for each of those days. Their recent searches are then displayed as
buttons that will display current and future conditions for that clicked location. This application
helped me familiarize myself with fethcing API URL links as well as researching API documentation
to determine what you can do with the given data.

## Features

This application runs in the browser which features dynamically updated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
